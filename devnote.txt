crash - weird - mouseover exit 0
* mousing over the top left corner of the gui causes the game to crash
* but it returns with status 0 and no message..?
** cause found
** main game loop in sfml.cpp
** "event.key.code == sf::Keyboard::Escape" triggers
|
part of bigger issue
mousing over the top parts of the GUI seem to trigger pressing the F## keys



Items
* currently finished loading, still need to generate description for scripting portions

Gui
* Make it display based on player session
** might need to implement fonts for this
